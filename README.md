## Project Introduction

The lane markings indicate the position of the lane to the human driver and guide the direction of the vehicle. Lane marking has always been one of the important topics of driverless driving, but how does the driverless car recognize the lane line? This project will identify the lane line with the Hough transform.


## Project Steps

The goals / steps of this project are the following: 
- Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
- Apply a distortion correction to raw images. 
- Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image. 
- Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
- Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
- Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center. 
- Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image. 
- Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position. 

## Project Result

The final result is as follows：
